\section{Carbonate platform evolution models}

Talk about stratigraphic forward modelling

\section{Model overview}

In this section, a new, deterministic three-dimensional carbonate forward model, pyReef is presented, which simulates reef growth, reef transport and lagoon development based on the coupling between four components: a wave transformation model, a long-term circulation model, a calcareous sand transport model and a carbonate production/disintegration fuzzy logic model (Fig.~\ref{pyreef_sketch}).

\noindent \textbf{pyReef} is an open-source and parallel model mainly written in Python and capable of simulating reef system evolution over time scale of hundreds to thousands of years and over 1 to 10's kilometres scale. The model source code, its associated documentation along with the input files for the examples discussed in this paper are available on Github (http://github.com/pyReef-model). The code is designed to be applied within a variety of environments, from fringing and barrier reefs to carbonate ramps and atolls.

\noindent Below we provide a detailed description of the physical algorithms implemented in pyReef as well as the key assumptions underlying our approach.

\subsection{Extrinsic forcings}

At basin-scale carbonate deposits are strongly controlled by large-scale forcings. Extrinsic processes will affect both the morphology of reef systems and stratigraphy of carbonate depositional sequences by modifying the carbonates production \citep{Hill06}. In pyReef, the following set of external forcing mechanisms could be considered: sea-level oscillations, subsidence/uplift rates, and regional oceanic conditions (\textit{i.e.} sea temperature and acidity).

\noindent Accomodation space is a function of relative sea-level changes, which is the sum effect of eustatic sea-level changes, tectonic changes and sediment supply. Several studies have shown that the rates of accretion of coral reefs are largely constrained by changes in accomodation space (\citet{VanWoesik15} or \citet{Roff15} to cite a few). In our model, a sea-level curve can be imported from either a known eustatic curve (\textit{e.g.} such as the ones from \citet{Haq87} or \citet{Miller05}) or directly defined by the user. The tectonic changes are provided as a series of temporal maps. Each map can have variable spatial cumulative displacements making it possible to simulate complex tectonic evolution with both uplift and subsidence conditions. These two forcing mechanisms will directly control the evolution of the hydrodynamic conditions and the associated sediment transport regime as well as the carbonate production described in the following subsections.

\noindent Changing sea surface temperatures and ocean acidification are known to have significant effects across reef systems by controlling the rate of coral reef growth \citep{Shaw12, Andersson13, Zhang13}. In pyReef, long-term regional scale evolution of either ocean's temperature or pH are set by the user as temporal-dependent functions. These functions are then used to control the carbonate production and disintegration as explained in subsection \ref{fuzzy}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Wave transformation}

SWAN, short for \textit{Simulating WAves Nearshore}, is a third-generation, finite-difference, wave model used to predict wave propagation in coastal areas and estuaries. It is governed by the wave action balance equation \citep{Bretherton68, Hasselmann73, Holthuijsen93, Booij99}:

\begin{equation}
 \frac{\partial N}{\partial t}+\nabla_{\vec{x}} \cdot \left[ \left( \vec{c_g} + \vec{U} \right) N \right] + \frac{\partial c_{\theta}N}{\partial \theta} + \frac{\partial c_{\sigma}N}{\partial \sigma} = \frac{S_{tot}}{\sigma}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $N(\vec{x},t,\sigma,\theta)$ is the wave action function of geographical space $\vec{x}$, time $t$, relative frequency $\sigma$ and wave direction $\theta$. $\nabla_{\vec{x}}$ is the gradient operator in space, $\vec{c_g}$ and $\vec{U}$ are the wave group velocity and ambient current vector respectively and $c_{\theta}$, $c_{\sigma}$ is the propagation velocity in $\theta$ and $\sigma$ domain. Finally $S_{tot}$ is the source term which can include wind, whitecapping, surf breaking and bottom friction \citep{Booij99}.

\noindent In our model, shoaling and refraction are accounted for from a series of deep-water wave conditions through time in the absence of wind forcing. Hence to compute wave field generation, the model requires bathymetric conditions and definitions of offshore significant wave height, characteristic period of the energy spectrum and wave direction and associated spreading angle.

\noindent To evaluate reef responses over several hundreds of years, the approach taken here does not examine temporal evolving wave fields, such as those produced during storm events and relies on SWAN stationary mode. In pyReef, the wave transformation model is generally performed for time intervals varying from $0.5$ to $10$ years. Our aim is to simulate realistic wave fields by imposing a sequence of wave forcing conditions (\textit{e.g.} series of fair-weather and/or storm events). At any given time interval, we define a percentage of activity for each deep-water wave conditions and the bathymetry is used to compute associated wave parameters. Possibility is given to derived these parameters for both low and high tides.

Combined with the climatic forcing described above, two additional wave factors could be adjusted in the model: the breaking parameter and the bottom friction.

\noindent In regions where wave height is close to water depth, wave breaking is an important source of energy dissipation on reefs \citep{Symonds95, Becker14}. This effect is typically approximated with a constant breaking parameter $\gamma_s$ \citep{Symonds95, Vetter10} which values have been calibrated for different reef systems \citep{Apotsos07, Vetter10, Monismith13, Franklin13, Rogers15}.

\noindent The high rugosity of reefs plays a significant role on wave dynamics by increasing the frictional dissipation of wave energy flux \citep{Young89, Lowe05, Lowe15}. This dissipation is usually approximated with a wave roughness friction factor $f_w$ which values have been well constrained for sand grain \citep{Kamphuis75, Grant79, Dean91}. In phase-averaged wave action approach like SWAN, this bottom dissipation is parameterised as a function of wave excursion to bottom roughness scale with a maximum value of 0.3 for $f_w$ \citep{Jonsson66, Madsen88}. Several studies \citep{Nelson96, Lowe05, Lentz15, Rogers15, Monismith15} indicates that this roughness factor can be much higher for reef systems (\textit{i.e.} up to 5.0 for reef platform in the Red Sea \citep{Lentz15}). To better estimate the impact of reef rugosity on frictional dissipation, we have modified the existing formulation for $f_w$ in SWAN and used the proposed parameterisation from \citet{Rogers15} based on  \citet{Swart74}:
\begin{equation}
  \def\arraystretch{1.4}
  f_w=\left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      exp\left[ a_1 \left( A_b / k_N \right)^{a_2} + a_3\right], \; A_b/k_N \ge 0.0369 \\
      50, \; A_b/k_N < 0.0369
    \end{array}
  \right.
\end{equation}
\noindent where $A_b$ is the wave excursion distance, $k_N$ is the bottom roughness scale and the coefficients $a_1=$5.213, $a_2=-$0.194, and $a_3=-$5.977 have been set based on \citet{Rogers15}  Palmyra study. Alternate coefficient from \citet{Nielsen92} can also be used ($a_1=$5.5, $a_2=-$0.2, and $a_3=-$6.3). For large values of $A_b/k_N$, this formulation is similar to the one from Madsen et al. [1988] (implemented in SWAN), but extends the parameterisation for lower $A_b/k_N$. In pyReef, the bottom friction is based on the proposed formulation and requires the definition of the bottom roughness scale ($k_N$) which values is generally set to 2-3 times the characteristic diameters of the studied region \citep{Nielsen92, Lowe05, Rogers15}.

\noindent For each forcing conditions, the wave transformation model computes and returns the significant wave height, the mean wave direction and the root-mean-square value of the maxima of the orbital velocity near the bottom. These parameters are subsequently used to evaluate the long-term hydrodynamic forces active over the simulated region.

\subsection{Long-term wave-driven circulation}

Flow circulation in and around reef platforms depends on the complex interactions between the overlying water motion and the three-dimensional bottom roughness formed by reef organisms. Attempts to numerically simulate flow dynamics around individual coral colonies have been proposed \citep{Kaandorp03, Chang09, Chindapol13} but such models require the flows to be solve down to few millimetres scale and are beyond the scope of our approach. Here we assume that the flow circulation in the reef platform is mainly driven by waves and regional-scale drivers of reefs hydrodynamics such as coastal upwelling or ocean currents are ignored. Numerical studies of wave-driven flow around reef systems commonly use depth-averaged Navier-Stokes equations \citep{Raupach82, Symonds95, Lowe05, Lowe09, Pomeroy12, Taebi11}. In the context of millennial scale reef platform evolution, these methods however are still computationally prohibitive. In pyReef, the proposed method consists in producing \textit{snapshots} of wave-driven circulation distribution resulting from series of deep-water wave scenarios by computing time-averaged cross-shore and longshore currents.

In nearshore environments, longshore current runs parallel to the shore and is generated by the radiation stresses associated with the breaking process for obliquely incoming waves and by the surplus water which is carried across the breaker zone towards the shoreline \citep{Longuet-Higgins70}. This current affect the transport and transfer of mass (loose carbonate sands, nutrients and carbon) in the nearshore reef waters \citep{Hamner88, Monismith07, Lowe15}. Many empirical formulation of longshore current have been proposed since the initial work from   \citet{Longuet-Higgins64}  \citep{Komar70, Komar75, Galvin87, Reniers97, Ruessink01, Grasmeijer03}. In pyReef, the approach from \citet{Komar75} is used to calculate the longshore current velocity ($\vec{v_l}$) in the middle of the breaking zone:
\begin{equation}
\vec{v_l} = \kappa_l u_{b} cos(\theta) sin(\theta) \vec{k}
\end{equation}
where $u_b$ is the maximum near-bed orbital velocity obtained from SWAN, $\theta$ the angle of incidence of the incoming waves, $\kappa_l$  a scaling parameter and $\vec{k}$ the unit vector parallel to the breaking depth contour. For wave rays approaching the reef at on oblique angle, the component of wave energy flux parallel to the reef shore will drives this longshore velocity. The calculation of the angle of incidence in pyReef is quite straightforward and requires an estimate of wave breaking depth (defined for each wave scenario) and wave direction (obtained from the wave transformation model).

In addition to longshore current, two types of cross-shore velocities are simulated in pyReef. First we estimate the onshore velocity which is essential in predicting the shoreward transport of broken carbonate particles during fair-weather periods  \citep{Elfrink99, Ruessink98}. In our model, we assume a linear dependency between the near-bed orbital velocity and the intensity of this onshore current $\vec{v_o}$:
\begin{equation}
\vec{v_o} = \kappa_o u_b \vec{n}
\end{equation}
with $u_b$ the maximum near-bed orbital velocity, $\vec{n}$ the unit vector parallel to the incoming wave direction and $\kappa_o$ a correction factor. $\kappa_o$ can be derived from local shallow reef water conditions and reflects natural wave skewness and asymmetry which are known to play a central part in cross-shore velocity profile \citep{Grasmeijer03, Crawford03}. The onshore velocity ($\vec{v_o}$) is usually associated to the wave crest and is stronger than the one due to the wave trough \citep{Isobe82, Grasmeijer03}.

During strong wave conditions, a second type of wave-induced cross-shore velocity is defined in pyReef and simulates an offshore-directed steady current referred to as undertow. The time-averaged and depth-averaged undertow velocity $\vec{v_u}$ is derived from the mass flux due to the wave motion and surface roller \citep{Svendsen87}. Under normal incident periodic waves, \citet{Longuet-Higgins75} showed that the depth- and time-averaged undertow velocity is related to the wave's kinetic energy density and phase speed. Assuming  equipartition of kinetic and potential wave energy, the total energy density of the wave is approximately \citep{Svendsen84}:
\begin{equation}
E_w = \frac{1}{8} \rho g H^2
\end{equation}
with $\rho$ the ocean density and  $H$ the root-mean-square wave height returned by SWAN. Following \citet{Cox98}, the undertow velocity is assumed to have the following form in our model:
\begin{equation}
\vec{v_u} = - \kappa_u \frac{\sqrt{g h}}{8} \left(\frac{H}{h} \right)^2 \vec{n}
\end{equation}
with $\kappa_u$ an empirical coefficient \citep{Kobayashi98}, $g$ the gravitational acceleration, $h$ the water depth and $\vec{n}$ the unit vector parallel to the incoming wave direction.

\subsection{Calcareous sand transport}

A common feature of many reef systems is the presence of diverse marine communities, including seagrasses, coral reef organisms, sponges and mangroves. Simulating the evolution of these communities involves to resolve the details of their individual transport by waves and currents at fine scale and therefore requires very advanced and computationally expensive numerical models \citep{Lowe16}. The approach proposed here is based on a parametric transport model that consider the main hydrodynamic forces presented in previous section and  relies on coral assemblages rather than individual communinities. Coral assemblages are derived from coral composition and comparison with modern coral zonation. In the Southern Great Barrier Reef, from 22 identified fossil coral species, \citet{Dechnik15} was able to define four main coral assemblages and their palaeoenvironments. In pyReef, multiple coral assemblages can be defined and we assume that each assemblage is made of hard and loose corals. The hard coral (\textit{e.g.} living part) can either grow in-situ or be disintegrated in loose particles. Only the loose particles are subject to transport and we assume that these particles can be represented by a unique diameter and density value.

To our knowledge, transport law for calcareous sand based on their hydraulic characteristics has not been proposed yet. It has been recognised \citep{Prager96, Day97, Smith04} that variations in the hydraulic properties between siliceous and calcareous sand due to both their shapes and fall velocities lead to different transport behaviors. From flume experiments, \citet{Smith05} shows that transport models designed for siliceous particles might be applied after a correction factor has been introduced. From their experiment, the model of \citet{Engelund67} seems to provide the best fit with their dataset, however they conclude that these corrections are not universally applicable.

\noindent Therefore, in pyReef, we have chosen to build our transport model based on a classical approach. Assuming sediment transport induced by waves and currents, our method is derived from Soulsby and Van Rijn formulation \citep{Soulsby97}. We compute the total load transport rate resulting from the addition of bed load and suspended load for each type of loose carbonate sands initially set by the user. The model also assumes that each of sand particles are perfectly sorted. The method suits well with our approach as it can be applied in a quasi-steady form. The transport rate is defined by:
\begin{equation}
q_t = (A_{sb}+A_{ss}) \bar{v} \left[ \sqrt{\bar{v}^2 + \frac{0.018}{C_D}u_b} - \bar{u_{cr}}\right]^{2.4} (1-1.6 \nabla z)
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\bar{v}$ is the depth-averaged current velocity obtained from the long-term wave driven circulation model defined in previous section, $C_D$ is the drag coefficient (due to current alone) and $\nabla z$ the slope. The bed load transport $A_{sb}$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
A_{sb}=\frac{0.005h(d/h)^{1.2}}{(s-1)gd}
\end{equation}
\noindent with $s$ is the relative density of sediments and $d$ is the median grain diameter. The suspended load transport $A_{ss}$ is obtained from the following formula:
\begin{equation}
A_{ss}=\frac{0.012hd_{\star}^{-0.6}}{(s-1)gd}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $d_{\star}$ refers to the dimensionless particle diameter.

\noindent The threshold current velocity of motion ($\bar{u_{cr}}$) is defined by:
\begin{equation}
  \arraycolsep=1.4pt\def\arraystretch{1.4}
  \bar{u_{cr}}=\left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      0.19\,d\,^{0.1}\,log_{10}(4h/d), & 0.1 \ge d \ge 0.5 \, \textrm{mm} \\
      8.5\,d\,^{0.6}\,log_{10}(4h/d), & 0.5 \ge d \ge 2. \, \textrm{mm}
    \end{array}
  \right.
\end{equation}

In addition, to the above sediment transport model a multi-lithology non-linear diffusion model has been implemented to simulate secondary gravity-driven transport processes happening over longer temporal scale than wave and current induced ones. Based on \citet{Rivenaes97} and considering $n$ different types of coral assemblages, the following set of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are used to calculate the proportion of each assemblage $a_k$:
\begin{equation}
  \arraycolsep=2pt\def\arraystretch{2}
    \begin{array}{l}
      \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k = 1 \\
      \frac{\partial z}{\partial t} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{c_k} \nabla \cdot ( \kappa_k a_k \nabla z) \\
      d_l \frac{\partial a_k}{\partial t} + a_k \frac{\partial z}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{C_k} \nabla \cdot ( \kappa_k a_k \nabla z)
    \end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\kappa_k$ denotes the diffusion coefficient for sediment $k$, $c_k$ is the compaction ratio and $d_l$ is a constant representing the thickness of a prescribed top layer, in which sediments are transported. This set of PDEs is solved using a fully explicit schema following the approach from \citet{Clark10}.

To simulate bed morphology and stratigraphic evolution a classical multi-level bed framework tracks the distribution of every coral assemblage through time by layers (\citet{Warner08} and reference therein). In pyReef, each layer stores the bulk properties including thickness and percentage of hard and loose coral assemblages. An active layer at the top of the stratigraphic pile is used to calculate the transport of the calcareous sand from both the wave-current driven and diffusion-based models presented above.

\subsection{Carbonate growth and disintegration}\label{fuzzy}

The organisation of coral reef systems is known to be large and complex and we are still limited in our understanding of their temporal and spatial evolution \citep{Demicco98}. Additionally, most datasets of carbonate systems are often linguistic, context-dependent, and based on measurements with large uncertainties. Conventional deterministic techniques are often enable to address many of the significant variables which affect carbonate productivity \citep{Parcell98}.

Alternative approaches such as fuzzy logic, which is by definition able to cope with these imprecisions \citep{Demicco01, Collin15}, have proven to be a viable alternative to simulate carbonate systems \citep{Salles11, Hattab13}. Fuzzy logic method is able to create logical propositions from qualitative data by using linguistic logic rules and \textit{fuzzy sets} \citep{Nordlund96}. These fuzzy sets are defined with continuous boundaries rather than \textit{crisp} discontinuous ones usually used in conventional approaches \citep{Meesters98}. In depth mathematical theory behind fuzzy logic method can be found in \citet{Zadeh65}, \citet{Zimmerman91} and \citet{Berkan97}.

\noindent Based on a fuzzy logic approach, carbonate system evolution in pyReef is driven entirely by a set of linguistic rules whose variables are fully adjustable. Therefore, the utility and effectiveness of the approach is mostly based on the user's understanding of the modelled carbonate system. The technique is specifically useful to understand how particular variable, in isolation or in combination with other factors, influences carbonate depositional geometries and reef adaptation.

In its current form, pyReef employs five types of control variables: depth, wave energy (derived from ocean bottom orbital velocity), sedimentation rate, ocean's temperature and acidity. For each of these variables, one can define a range of fuzzy sets using membership functions \citep{Nordlund99}. A membership function is a curve showing the degree of truth (\textit{i.e.} ranging between 0 and 1) of membership in a particular fuzzy set. In pyReef, these curves can be simple triangles, trapezoids, bell-shaped curves, or have more complicated shapes. Production and/or disintegration of any specific coral assemblage is then computed from a series of fuzzy rules. A fuzzy rule is a logic \textit{if-then} rule defined from the fuzzy sets \citep{Demicco01}. In our model, the combination of the fuzzy sets in each fuzzy rule is restricted to the \textit{and} operator. The amalgamation of competing fuzzy rules is usually referred to as a fuzzy system. Summation of multiple rules from the fuzzy system by truncation of the membership functions produces a new fuzzy answer in the form of a new membership set. The last step consists in computing a single number for this fuzzy set through \textit{defuzzification} \citep{Zadeh65}. In pyReef, the centroid (center of gravity) for the area below the membership set is taken as the \textit{defuzzified} output value.

Coupling of the wave transformation approach (SWAN) with the long-term circulation and sediment transport models and with the fuzzy logic technique presented above allow for numerical analysis of carbonate platforms evolution, stratigraphic architecture reconstruction and provides a numerical framework to quantitatively assess reef system responses to climatic forcing over millennial scales.

%  SECTION HEADS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for
% prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
% three or fewer letters).

% AGU follows standard outline style; therefore, there cannot be a section 1 without
% a section 2, or a section 2.3.1 without a section 2.3.2.
% Please make sure your section numbers are balanced.
% ---------------
% Level 1 head
%
% Use the \section{} command to identify level 1 heads;
% type the appropriate head wording between the curly
% brackets, as shown below.
%
%An example:
%\section{Level 1 Head: Introduction}
%
% ---------------
% Level 2 head
%
% Use the \subsection{} command to identify level 2 heads.
%An example:
%\subsection{Level 2 Head}
%
% ---------------
% Level 3 head
%
% Use the \subsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
%An example:
%\subsubsection{Level 3 Head}
%
%---------------
% Level 4 head
%
% Use the \subsubsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
% An example:
%\subsubsubsection{Level 4 Head} An example.

%  IN-TEXT LISTS

%
%  EQUATIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}

% IF YOU HAVE MULTI-LINE EQUATIONS, PLEASE
% BREAK THE EQUATIONS INTO TWO OR MORE LINES
% OF SINGLE COLUMN WIDTH (20 pc, 8.3 cm)
% using double backslashes (\\).

% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.


%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

%  SIDEWAYS FIGURE AND TABLE EXAMPLES
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
%
% For tables and figures, add \usepackage{rotating} to the paper and add the rotating.sty file to the folder.
% AGU prefers the use of {sidewaystable} over {landscapetable} as it causes fewer problems.
